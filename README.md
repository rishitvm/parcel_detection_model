## Parcel Detection Model
# Overview
This repository contains a parcel detection model designed to identify and locate parcels in images using advanced computer vision techniques. The model is trained to enhance accuracy and efficiency in parcel detection applications.

# Features
High Accuracy: Leverages state-of-the-art algorithms for reliable parcel detection.
Real-Time Processing: Capable of processing images in real-time for practical applications.
Flexible Framework: Easily adaptable for different environments and use cases.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your framework)
- OpenCV
- NumPy

# How It Works
The parcel detection model utilizes a deep learning architecture (such as YOLO) to identify and classify parcels in images. The model processes the input image and outputs bounding boxes around detected parcels, enabling further analysis or actions.
